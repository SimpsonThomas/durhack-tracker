Just a brief explanation about what our app aims to do

You can check it our by running it locally with `npm run dev` and going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

You can also check it out on our instances running on AWS Amplify - [Dev](https://dev.d3jn2is8vx7q5l.amplifyapp.com/) and [Master](https://dev.d3jn2is8vx7q5l.amplifyapp.com/) both have their own instances

## Problem
With online lectures often being asyncronous and not matching directly with traditional lecture slots students can lose track of where they are meant to be

They often find it hard to keep up across all their modules simply because they don't understand how the content is ordered


## Aims
To provide an interface to track your progress through an online course

To show where the lecturer expects you to be at in the course

To show where the average student has got to

To allow you to mark lecturers watched, complete online tests to confirm understanding

To gamify these features to make it enjoyable for the student


## What we've achieved
We haven't managed to create the complete interface - more a design mock-up for the end product built in Next.js running on AWS Amplify

You can choose mock students, see their randomly generated progress in some modules

The green marks where the student has reached

The under and over lined section is where the lecturer expects the student to be

We also have a leaderboard, again with stub data, to show the gamification features we hope to build


## What we want to do
Ideally this would be built directly into DUO to allow it to automatically sync with watched lecturers, recieve formative and summative marks from assignments to allow students the simplest possible experience
